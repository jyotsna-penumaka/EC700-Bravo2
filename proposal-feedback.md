# What is the project

Sounds good overall. I'd keep the scope broader than Mirai (and related variants), and make clear that Mirai just serves as a very popular example.

# Why is tackling this project important

Sounds good.

# How do you plan on tackling the project

Timeline sounds very ambitious (I like it).

``Test the system with Mirai's executable'' sounds as if you'll have a fully functional (for executables) prototype by March 14 -- again, *very* ambitous.

Please keep me up-to-date (as soon as you know) with respect to the Linux platform, emulator, frameworks, and target devices you choose (below says openWRT, sounds good to me)

# List of 3 sets of deliverables

## Passing grade

Demonstrate defense on openWRT but against what? I suggest to use a couple of Mirai or other IoT malware samples.

## Set of deliverables that will yield an A grade

Sounds good to me. I'm not sure whether libraries are more challenging than binary executables (i.e., you might want to consider merging libraries with the above goal). Scripts is certainly more challenging than libraries.

## Set of deliverables that shows work clearly beyond an A

Detect malware infection at initial exploit is a whole project on it's own, so that's probably a bit far-fetched.

How about we do
Passing grade -> support binary executables
A grade -> also support libraries
A+ grade -> scripts
